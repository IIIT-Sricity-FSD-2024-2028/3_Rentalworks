#  PG Rental Property Management System

A centralized, broker-free digital platform designed to support **PG (Paying Guest) accommodation discovery, booking, and post-booking management**, with a strong focus on tenant–warden coordination and PG operations.

---

##  Problem Statement

Rapid urbanization and increased mobility of students and working professionals in India have led to a growing demand for PG accommodations.  
However, the current PG ecosystem is largely **unorganized and broker-driven**, resulting in:

- Lack of transparency in PG listings  
- Difficulty in finding PGs based on personal preferences
- Poor communication between tenants and wardens  
- No digital mechanism to manage PG operations after booking  

Most existing platforms focus only on **PG search and booking**, but fail to support **PG management once the tenant joins**.

The **PG Rental Property Management System** aims to provide a **single integrated platform** that enables end-to-end PG discovery, booking, and **complete post-booking PG management**.
